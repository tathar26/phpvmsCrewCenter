Install:

-Download the attached package.
-unzip the package and place the files as structured in your root phpVMS install.
-use the event.sql file to create the tables needed in your sql database using phpmyadmin or similar.
-create a link in your admin navigation panel
I put it on line 54 in admin/lib/layout/header.php

<li><a href="<?php echo SITE_URL?>/admin/index.php/events_admin">Events</a></li>


-create a link in your main site nav bar

<li><a href="<?php echo url('/events') ?>">Events</a></li>


This is a VERY BASIC BETA version of this module. It only includes basic functionality and is currently under further development. It is only being released in this BETA form for community input on further options.

The Slot Limit determines how many open slots are available to pilots for signing up beyond the slots that are already reserved. - I would suggest not editing this after you have created the event and have signups.

The Slot Interval is how many minutes are between each Slot Reservation. This is not editable once you set the number in the creation of the event.
